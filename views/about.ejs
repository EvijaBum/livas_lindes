    				<p>I`m a <br><span class="caps">PHOTOGRAPHER</span><br> who has fallen in love with mountains, cumulus clouds, 
    				outdoor expeditions and suistanable traveling. I love to meet people, listen 
    				to their experiences, and bring their stories to life through the images I create. 
    				Alike I love to work with childrens, take part in meaningful events, search for details,
    				creative angles and focus on composition and colours.</p>

    					<p>I’m a <br><span class="caps">WRITER</span><br> who loves to write letters of travel, stories that matter, and finding ways
    					of telling more with less words. I like to play a bit with poetry, put a bit of philosophy 
    					in my writing, but still keep every article simple, logical, and understandable. With a bit 
    					of creativity it’s possible to make authentic stories which bring you closer to a person or
    					area of the world. </p>

    				and the sound when rain drops hit the tent. Outdoor lifestyle is my passion and biggest inspiration. 
    				Since my childhood I have been interested in exploring the world and searching for ways  how I can 
    				learn more, see more, understand more and be more trough my life journey.  </p>
